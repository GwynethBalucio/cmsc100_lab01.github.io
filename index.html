                    <p class="why">
                        I already found logic design and circuitry an interesting discussion back in junior high. The thing I like most about this
                        major is that we got to do math with Boolean algebra while illustrating the design of combinational and sequential circuits. 
                        It's sort of like a mash up of two of my favorite topics: math and art. Another reason is that I get to rest my eyes from the screen whenever 
                        I need to do our exercises, which were mostly pen-and-paper reliant.

                    <p class="why">
                        I never got to appreciate our country's history back in elementary. In college, HIST 1 gave me a better perspective on events that happened in the past. While giving
                        us the opportunity to learn about our history in a critical and objective way, we were encouraged to humanize the people who experienced the past
                        and not alienate them just because we often feel that they are different from the present. With that, I got to learn from this subject that the best way for us to do at present
                        is to acknowledge our past and learn from it so we can afford a better security for our rights in the future.

                    <p class="why">
                        HTML and CSS are the first programming languages that I learned. These languages are also one of the reasons
                        why I considered taking Computer Science for college. I have a lot of fun coding and designing websites, practiced them when I was in 
                        grade 7 and in my Immersion activities back in grade 12. I enjoyed HTML because it was easy to learn about it myself, and I liked CSS 
                        because of how design can visually emphasize the structure of the HTML document.

                        Despite the way some people belittle the term due to its association with a certain public servant, I've always been fond of this humble cuisine.
                        Ever since childhood, I love it whenever I get the chance to eat it for my merienda. A lot of things are easy with this meal: it's easy to cook, 
                        find in nearby canteens, affordable, easy to swallow when you're sick, etc. I just hope that those who serve this meal can also have it easy with their lives.

                    <p class="why">
                        When I was a kid and people asked me what I wanted to be, I never gave a concrete answer. I remember my parents telling me 
                        that I'd say I wanted to become a dentist, then a medical technologist, or a librarian, or architect, or whatever. It was
                        until I grew up when I realized that I never really had a dream in my entire childhood - I just gave an answer to people who'd ask. I guess
                        I was still too young to realize the things that actually mattered to me. Now that I'm older, I dream of having a financially and emotionally 
                        stable life with a job in computer science and freelance art, and pay for whatever my family may need in the future.
